# dotfiles

My lovely little dotfiles repository

## To install

Run the following command:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaxsonp/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh
```

This command clones this repository into the home directory and adds a cron job

## To manually sync

Nothing needs to be done after install
